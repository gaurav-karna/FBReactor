# FBReactor
Automatic reactor to facebook messages.

Considered using the Facebook Graph API to simplify things, but I do not plan to scale this project and hence do not want to go through the troubles of user permissions.

Decided to stick to the more hacky way of doing it - Selenium x GeckoDriver :dragon: x Firefox :fire:
