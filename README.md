# FBReactor
Automatic reactor to facebook messages.

Considered using the Facebook Graph API to simplify things, but I do not plan to scale this project and hence do not want to go through the troubles of user permissions.

Decided to use a Python wrapper API for logging in, session handling, and messaging tasks. :fire:
